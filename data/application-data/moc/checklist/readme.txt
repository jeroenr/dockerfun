<!-- checklist properties :
         'name' and 'version' : self explanatory, these are also defined on the businessobjecttype of the
             changeanalysis (checklist), when a new version is created in this xml file, also update the
             corresponding property settings on the relevant businessobjecttypes.
         'localized' : true/false, when true, for each label in this xml we can use a code that will be localized.
             when false, we must input the actual labels in this xml file, so only the language supported in this
             xml file will be available
         'label' : holds either the localization code for the label or the actual label to display (also see 'localized')
